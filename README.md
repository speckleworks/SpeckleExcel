2. Sideload the app:

	- [Sideload Office Add-ins in Office on the web](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing)


## Server requirements
- SpeckleExcel requires updated Speckle servers (minimum [commit](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleServer/commit/9e135c453a93608a7e75d0317407070a64bdcea7) supported)
- Please ensure that your Speckle server has `https://excel.speckle.systems` specified under `REDIRECT_URL` within the `.env` file

## Build Setup

SpeckleExcel contains two Office add-ins to sideload, one for release and one for development:
- SpeckleExcel: uses `https://excel.speckle.systems` as the plugin source
- SpeckleExcelDev: uses `https://localhost:8080` as the plugin source
  - Make sure to add the certificate from `https://localhost:8080` before loading the plugin

### Build instructions

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run start

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
